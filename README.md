# Traffic Density Analyzer

This project aims to monitor and analyze traffic density in real-time using Arduino-based sensors. It dynamically adjusts traffic signals to optimize traffic flow and reduce congestion in urban areas.

## Project Overview

The **Traffic Density Analyzer** utilizes embedded systems and sensor data to track vehicle movement, analyze traffic patterns, and implement intelligent traffic signal management.

## Features
- **Real-time traffic monitoring** using ultrasonic sensors
- **Data analysis** to determine traffic density at different intervals
- **Dynamic traffic signal adjustment** based on traffic density
- **Efficient congestion management** for smoother traffic flow

## Tech Stack
- **Hardware**: Arduino Uno, Ultrasonic Sensors
- **Programming Language**: C/C++
- **Tools**: Arduino IDE

## How It Works
1. **Sensor Data Collection**: The ultrasonic sensors are used to measure the distance between vehicles at different intervals.
2. **Traffic Density Calculation**: Based on the sensor data, the system calculates the vehicle density.
3. **Signal Adjustment**: The system adjusts the traffic signals dynamically according to the traffic density to avoid congestion.
